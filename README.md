# Quantum Factoring with Shor's Algorithm

## Introduction  
This project demonstrates integer factoring using quantum computing, inspired by notable research. It showcases Shor's algorithm's efficiency compared to classical methods.

## Detailed Algorithm of Calculation

1. **Preparation**: Choose a random number less than the target and check it's co-prime.
2. **Quantum Superposition**: Create a quantum state representing all possible outcomes.
3. **Period Finding**: Use Quantum Fourier Transform to discover the function's periodicity.
4. **Classical Post-processing**: Employ the period to derive factors through classical computations.

This simplified algorithm combines quantum mechanics' power with classical computing's reliability to factor numbers efficiently.
